Overview
My Healthy Pregnancy App is an Android app designed to help pregnant women identify potentially harmful ingredients in their skincare products or personal care products. The app allows users to take a picture of the product label or upload an image from their device, and then uses Google's ML Kit to recognize the text on the label. The app then checks the recognized text against a list of ingredients to avoid during pregnancy and highlights any matches.

Users can click on highlighted ingredients to open a Google search for more information on the ingredient and whether it is safe to use during pregnancy. The app also includes a camera feature for convenient label scanning, and a list of common ingredients to avoid during pregnancy.
